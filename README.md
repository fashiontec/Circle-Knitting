#Engineering a printable circular knitting machine with an optional mini-computer
---------------------

##Background

There are commercial circular knitting machines, that are nearly completely made from plastic. A popular modul is the Addi Express. Plastic can be easily printed out on 3D printers. So, we came up with the idea to code a circular knitting machine. As inexpensive small PCs components like the Rapsberry PI and Arduinos become increasingly powerful there is even an option to include them as optional components in such a 3D printed knitting machine.

##Features

* 22 or 46 needle. 
* Can create circular and rectangular swatches (using back-and-forth knit)
* Max swatch for 46 needle: 17.75 inch
* Manual cast-on and bind-off
* Manual forwarding

##Motivation

* Be able to replicate using distributed digital manufacturing (3d-print/CNC)
* Be able to customize. Different number of needles, needle/mask size, adapting to different materials, adding automation
